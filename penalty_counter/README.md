##  Welcome to Penalty Counter MVP 

The project is a simple penalty shooter, that pitches two teams against each other, and randomly determines whether that team scored the penalty or not,  
and once all penalties have been thrown it outputs a result, and the option to restart the game 

This project was meant to solidify my understanding of software principles such as separation of concerns, by using the Feynman technique, which basically says
if you can't explain a difficult concept in simple words, you do not understand it.
